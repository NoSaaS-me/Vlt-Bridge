# Add hover preview cards for wikilinks

## Overview

Implement HoverCard popups that show a preview of linked notes when hovering over wikilinks in the NoteViewer, similar to Wikipedia's preview feature.

## Rationale

Currently clicking a wikilink navigates away from the current note. Users often want to peek at linked content without losing their place. HoverCard component from Radix UI is already installed but unused in this context.
