# Fix XSS vulnerability in search snippet rendering

## Overview

The SearchWidget component uses `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` to render search result snippets without sanitization. Search snippets are generated by SQLite FTS5's snippet() function which wraps matches in <mark> tags, but the underlying note content is user-generated and could contain malicious HTML/JavaScript that gets executed in the browser.

## Rationale

Cross-site scripting (XSS) allows attackers to inject malicious scripts that can steal session tokens, perform actions on behalf of users, or redirect to phishing pages. Since notes can be created via MCP by AI agents or directly by users, malicious content could be injected into any note.
