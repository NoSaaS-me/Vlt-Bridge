# ⚠️  SECURITY WARNING - MCP AUTHENTICATION BYPASS ⚠️
# ENABLE_NOAUTH_MCP is EXTREMELY DANGEROUS and should NEVER be enabled in production!
#
# When enabled (true), this setting:
#   - Bypasses ALL authentication for MCP endpoints
#   - Allows ANYONE to access, modify, and delete user data
#   - Allows ANYONE to consume paid API resources (Oracle/RAG/TTS)
#   - Exposes sensitive information without any access control
#
# This setting exists ONLY for isolated development/testing environments where:
#   - The server is NOT exposed to any network (localhost only)
#   - You are the ONLY user accessing the system
#   - You understand the security implications
#
# PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT CHECKLIST:
#   ✓ Ensure this is set to "false" (or unset, which defaults to false)
#   ✓ Verify JWT_SECRET_KEY is set to a strong, random secret
#   ✓ Never expose unauthenticated endpoints to the internet
#   ✓ Use proper OAuth/JWT authentication for all users
#
# Default: false (KEEP IT THIS WAY IN PRODUCTION!)
